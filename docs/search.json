Here, I document my journey through the Social Data Analytics and Research program, focusing on the intersection of data science, social patterns, and actionable insights.\nAbout Me\nI am a graduate student currently exploring the world of Knowledge Mining, NLP, and predictive modeling. My goal is to leverage data-driven methodologies to solve complex social problems.\nFeatured Coursework\n\nKnowledge Mining\nExploring the DIKW hierarchy, neural extraction methods, and the “AI for Science” paradigm to transform raw data into actionable insights.\n\n\nData Collection Methods\nFocusing on the systematic gathering of social data, survey design, and ensuring data integrity for robust research outcomes.\n\n\nData Visualization\nTranslating complex data sets into intuitive, high-impact visual narratives to aid in decision-making and public communication.\nContact\n\nGitHub: AdileneGaribay\nEmail: dal661311@utdallas.edu\n\n\nThis website was developed as part of my graduate coursework. Technical assistance and structural guidance were provided by Gemini 1.5 Flash (LLM)."
